# Archived Design Documents

Documents may appear in the `rfcs/archived` directory for one of 
three reasons:

1. The document describes a feature or extension that has been deprecated.
2. The document describes a feature or extension that has been deprecated and then removed.
3. The document describes a feature or extension that was proposed but did
not (ultimately) become a fully support feature. 

Design documents that appear in `rfcs/archived` folder should include a 
section that describes why the document has been archived.
