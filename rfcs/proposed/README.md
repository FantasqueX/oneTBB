# Design documents for proposed features

Proposed features have reached some level of consensus within the 
community. A proposal appears in this directory because the
community believes it has merit and further work should be done.
However, the proposed changes have not yet been released as a
preview or fully supported feature of the library.

RFCs in the `rfcs/proposed` directory, should describe the motivation,
design and open questions related to the proposed extension.
